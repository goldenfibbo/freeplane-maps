# Freeplane mind-maps for personal studies
## mind-maps created while learning in research or just out of curiosity
* Representing personal understanding and may contain a few errors or biases
* Most ended up unfinished, due to irregular changes of research or curiosity(happening all the time)
* Created mainly for review instead of preview, not for learning from scratch
