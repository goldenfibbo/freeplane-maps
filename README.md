# Freeplane mind-maps for personal studies
## mind-maps created by myself while learning topics in research or just out of curiosity
* They totally come out of my personal understanding of knowledges, which means I won't assure the accuracy.  
* Due to the irregular changes of my studying plan (happen all the time), most of them may end up unfinished.
* These are created purely for my future review, not for preview, so it may not be understandable for others.
* Some of them were created by Docear and may bring up some errors when opening, but it won't affect usage.
